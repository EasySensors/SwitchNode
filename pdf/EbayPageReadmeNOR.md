### The Switch Node is a low cost wireless Arduino IDE compatible (the Atmel ATMega328P) microcontroller with footprint ready for HopeRF RFM69-CW or SMD NRF24L01+ 2.4 GHz radio. Comes with build in hardware debouncer. Best suitable for Home Automation, IOT. Could be used as switch board for radio controlling any DIY project.

## Features
- Fully compatible with the Arduino IDE (PRO MINI 8 MG Hz)
- Over the Air, firmware updates (OTA) ready. In combination with preprogrammed Dual Optiboot boot loader and on board External JDEC  EPROM\Flash memory the Node allows OTA software updates.
- Footprints for both HopeRF RFM69-CW or SMD NRF24L01+ 2.4 GHz Radio Transceivers
- Onboard Atmel ATSHA204A CryptoAuthentication chip makes communication with the Node very secured. ATSHA204A implements secured handshake and if handshake fails the Node will not executing any command sent to it
- Programming header is FTDI, TTL Serial. For programming you need to have USB TTL Serial â€“ FTDI adaptor
- ENIG Emersion Gold finish
- MySensors compatible. You can use superb set of scripts and libraries from [mysensors.org](http://www.mysensors.org) project  and convert the nodes into reliable network of little home sensors, relays and actuators.
- Supports both ON/OFF and momentary switches 
- Battery connector CR2450
- Yes, it is open sourced. Completely.

Comes with Arduino example sketch.

## Overview
If you are familiar with Arduino boards, the Switch Node is Arduino pro Mini ready foor HopeRF RFM69 or NRF24L01+ 2.4 GHz radio installed, external EPROM flash and crypto authentication chip. To save some board dimensions the Switch Node does not have onboard USB-Serial converter. You need to buy FTDI Adapter for programming. HopeRF RFM69-CW provide extremely good range. Hundreds of meters in open areas. External Flash chip allows burning Arduino sketch wirelessly. Onboard Atmel ATSHA204A CryptoAuthentication chip secures communication with other controllers.
