### The Switch Node is a low cost wireless Arduino IDE compatible (the Atmel ATMega328P) microcontroller with HopeRF RFM69-CW 433 MHz radio on board and build in hardware debouncer. Best sutable for Home Automation, IOT. Could be used as switch board for radio controlling any DIY project.

## Features
- Fully compatible with the Arduino IDE (PRO MINI 8 MG Hz)
- Over the Air, firmware updates (OTA) ready. In combination with preprogrammed Dual Optiboot boot loader and  on board External JDEC  EPROM\Flash memory the Node allows OTA software updates.
- Onboard RFM69-CW 433 MHz Radio Transceiver  with wire antenna
- Onboard Atmel ATSHA204A CryptoAuthentication chip makes communication with the Node very secured. ATSHA204A implements secured handshake and if handshake fails the Node will not executing any command sent to it
- Programming header is FTDI, TTL Serial. For programming you need to have  USB TTL Serial â€“ FTDI adaptor
- ENIG Emersion Gold finish
- MySensors compatible. You can use superb set of scripts and libraries from [mysensors.org](http://www.mysensors.org) project  and convert the node into reliable network of little home sensors, relays and actuators.
- Battery connector CR2450
- Yes, it is open sourced. Completely.

Comes with Arduino example sketch and some IOT ideas based on the switch node and similar controllers.
